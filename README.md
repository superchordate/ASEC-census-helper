# Why Census Source?

ASEC data is incredibly valuable, but existing tools for finding and extracting data are difficult to use. **Census Source** provides a fast and user-friendly tool to select and download data from the ASEC.

# About the Data

**What are the Supplements?**

From [health.gov](https://health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/data-sources-and-methods/data-sources/current-population-survey-annual-social-and-economic-supplement-cps-asec):

> The Current Population Survey (CPS) is a monthly survey that provides  current estimates and trends in employment, unemployment, earnings, and  other characteristics of the general labor force, the population as a  whole, and various population subgroups. The Annual Social and Economic  Supplement (CPS-ASEC) is conducted annually in the months of February,  March, and April. In addition to the usual monthly labor force data, this supplement provides information on work experience, income, noncash benefits, and migration of persons ages 15 years and older.
