# census-source
One stop for easy access to 700 fields across 3 tables from the [Social and Economic Supplements](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2020/demo/cps/cps-asec-2020.html) to the Current Population Survey.

*Census source is in development. Some of the value mappings are not complete. More to come!*

# Quickstart

How to get the most out of Census Source:

1. Click around to find and **select data fields**.
2. **Preview** data in the app.
3. **Download** your data in CSV format. CS will find your data and perform necessary joins so you get a single, ready-to-use ASEC dataset.
4. Plop your data into Power BI or Tableau to **continue exploring**!

*Pro Tip: **Bookmark** or **Share** the URL to select the same fields again later.* 

* Previews are grouped, but downloads will give you data that is not summarized.
* Downloads will include relevant record keys to connect observations over time (longitudinal).

# Why Census Source?

ASEC data is incredibly valuable, but existing tools for finding and extracting data are difficult to use. **Census Source** provides a fast and user-friendly tool to select and download data from the ASEC.

| Different years are in different files.       | 2019 and 2020 are combined. Long term, we'd like to get the last 10 years into the app. |
| Over 700 fields.                              | Only download the fields you need.                           |
| Field names are not intuitive.                | Field names are replaced with their human-readable descriptions and tagged with the table they come from. |
| Values are keys (1, 2, 3 vs. high, med, low). | Values are human-readable and ready-to-use.                  |

# About the Data

**What are the Supplements?**

From [health.gov](https://health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/data-sources-and-methods/data-sources/current-population-survey-annual-social-and-economic-supplement-cps-asec):

> The Current Population Survey (CPS) is a monthly survey that provides  current estimates and trends in employment, unemployment, earnings, and  other characteristics of the general labor force, the population as a  whole, and various population subgroups. The Annual Social and Economic  Supplement (CPS-ASEC) is conducted annually in the months of February,  March, and April. In addition to the usual monthly labor force data, this supplement provides information on work experience, income, noncash benefits, and migration of persons ages 15 years and older.
